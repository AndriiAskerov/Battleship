# Battleship
A terminal hotseat game for two players written in Java

Each player has his own map and a fleet to place down. After each player have settled his warships the clash begins. Each turn a player who holds initiative shoots at a disered location of the opponent's map. If the shot hits the opponent's ship, the player holds initiative and takes another shot.

All the work is published at the "master" branch here.
